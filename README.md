# Legend of Cube
3D platformer using Monogame starring a Cube.

## Building
Currently only Windows is supported. Likely it's possible to create a cross platform project as well.

### Requirements

- __Monogame__ (development build, 3.3.0.1963 as of writing)

#### Monogame
1. Download `MonoGameSetup.exe` either by [this link](http://teamcity.monogame.net/repository/download/MonoGame_DevelopWin/latest.lastSuccessful/Windows/MonoGameSetup.exe?guest=1) or by going to http://www.monogame.net/downloads/ and under the heading "Developments Builds" download "MonoGame for Visual Studio".
